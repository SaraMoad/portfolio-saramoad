                    I was able to enjoy creative pursuits in my previous roles as a professional dancer and a teacher of dance which enabled
                    me to explore that magic and creativity in a variety of situations with both children and adults. I have enjoyed applying 
                    this same creativity to my work in development to create intuitive applications. You'll also find me applying this on weeknights
                    to my characters as I play Dungeons and Dragons.
